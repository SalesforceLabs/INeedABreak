# SF Labs - Out of Office Requestor

![AppExchange Logo](./img/Title_OutOfOfficeRequest.jpg "AppExchange Logo")

We all love Time off don’t we? What we do not like though, is when you get back to the office, realize that work has piled up and your inbox is exploding. All of that, because you didn’t have the option to assign your work items to a backup in Salesforce!

Wouldn’t it be great if you can actually focus on your time off without having to worry if action item in Salesforce aren’t stuck?

Good news! This App provides you the option to assign a Backup who will get all your tasks, cases or any other relevant records while your are Out of the Office. Best of all, this App is completely free of charge, so you can simply install it and go. Enjoy!
